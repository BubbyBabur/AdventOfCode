# Advent of Code 2020
I know what you're thinking, a literal caveman descended from 10,000 BCE and hammered out this code with his flint and stone. I- I have no defense. Yeah. That's accurate. This was my first advent of code, and I switched from Java to JS halfway through. I also stopped using an output file once my first and only brain cell revitalized from its 20 day nap and decided, hey, why can't we just use the console to output stuff?

I know, I'm an uncultured troglodyte. But I already know that. So stop judging me and go do something productive.

But yes, I did finish all problems. Caveman brain actually decided to get its act together and poop out something useful.
